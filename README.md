# Mixed Messages

For this project, I built a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new randomized output.
I decided to expand the program by adding a *greeting* and *emoji* randomly selected. 

The **Project Objectives:**
 - Build a message generator program using JS
 - Use Git version control
 - Use command line
 - Develop locally

### Technology

I'll be using:
* JavaScript
* Git and GitHub
* Command Line

### Launch

Use *node.js* to run code. Or JS Interpreter.

**I welcome any feedback on syntax, code structure, or any other recommendations.**
